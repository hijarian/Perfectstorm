* This section is not ported yet: http://www.cairographics.org/manual/cairo-Win32-Fonts.html (but who cares? .. :P)

* Search for the string TODO in the *.lisp-files. :)

* Add a with-macros for context and create/destroy-pairs of functions.
  Maybe some reference-counting stuff? I'm not sure.

* Maybe a higher-level toolkit, that uses CLOS. This should be in SWCairo I think.

* Make the coercelet-thing optional. Or is it really needed at all? => Naw, I've removed it.

* Exception-handling, instead of return-values. I think. I guess this should be in SWCairo.
